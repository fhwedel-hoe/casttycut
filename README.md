# casttycut

This is meant to be an editor's tool for [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) recordings with sound – as produced by [castty](https://github.com/dhobsd/castty).

I never got around to implement the actual code for cutting (as in "removing parts"), but for now it is a browser-based player which can at least *seek* to individual events decently.

For actual editing, you might want to look at [asciinema-edit](https://github.com/cirocosta/asciinema-edit) – though that one does not care about sound.
